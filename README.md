# 🧹 ClipperTool — The Clipboard Cleanup Commander!

Welcome to **ClipperTool**, your new best friend in the wild west of clipboard chaos.  
Whether you're a productivity ninja, a code samurai, or just someone who copies way too much junk, ClipperTool is here to save your sanity.

---

## What is ClipperTool? 🤔

ClipperTool is a slick, modern clipboard manager with a twist:  
It **automatically cleans your clipboard text** by removing or keeping only lines containing your secret list of forbidden (or beloved) words.

- **Remove mode** — Kick out the bad lines like a bouncer at a club.  
- **Keep mode** — Keep only the VIP lines, everything else gets the boot.

No more annoying copy-paste clutter. Just clean, laser-focused clipboard content every time.

## Features 💥

- **🔍 Clipboard monitoring** — Runs quietly in the background, waiting for your clipboard to get messy.  
- **⚙️ Configurable filters** — Edit simple text files to control exactly what you want removed or kept.  
- **🔄 Multiple filter sets** — Switch between configs like changing hats.  
- **✨ Modern GUI** — A sleek, sexy interface powered by ttkbootstrap (because ugly UI is so 2000s).  
- **🎛️ Two modes** — Remove or keep lines, toggled with a single click.  
- **🎨 Icon included** — Fancy favicon.ico because details matter.  
- **📂 Portable configs** — Store your filter lists in `Documents/ClipperTool/Configs/`, so no surprises when updating.  
- **⚡ Lightweight and fast** — Like a ninja, but for your clipboard.
